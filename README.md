DAY 1 : Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

DAY 2 : Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".
A happy number is a number defined by the following process: 
Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits,
and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), 
or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.


DAY 3 : Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.


DAY 4 : Given an array nums, write a function to move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.

DAY 5: Say you have an array for which the ith element is the price of a given stock on day i.
Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).

DAY 6 : Given an array of strings, group anagrams together.
Input: ["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"],
Output:
[
  ["ate","eat","tea"],
  ["nat","tan"],
  ["bat"]
]

DAY 7 : Given an integer array arr, count element x such that x + 1 is also in arr.

If there're duplicates in arr, count them seperately.
Example 1:

Input: arr = [1,2,3]
Output: 2
Explanation: 1 and 2 are counted cause 2 and 3 are in arr.

DAY 8 : Given a non-empty, singly linked list with head node head, return a middle node of linked list.
If there are two middle nodes, return the second middle node.

DAY 9 : Given two strings S and T, return if they are equal when both are typed into empty text editors. # means a backspace character.
Input: S = "ab#c", T = "ad#c"
Output: true
Explanation: Both S and T become "ac".

DAY 10 : Design a stack that supports push, pop, top, and retrieving the minimum element in constant time.

push(x) -- Push element x onto stack.
pop() -- Removes the element on top of the stack.
top() -- Get the top element.
getMin() -- Retrieve the minimum element in the stack.
 
DAY 11 :Given a binary tree, you need to compute the length of the diameter of the tree. The diameter of a binary tree is the length of the longest path between any two nodes in a tree. This path may or may not pass through the root.
