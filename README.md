# 30 Days of code LEET CODE
DAY 1 : Given a non-empty array of integers, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.

DAY 2 : Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".
A happy number is a number defined by the following process: 
Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits,
and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), 
or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.


DAY 3 : Given an integer array nums, find the contiguous subarray (containing at least one number) which has the largest sum and return its sum.


DAY 4 : Given an array nums, write a function to move all 0's to the end of it while maintaining the relative order of the non-zero elements.
