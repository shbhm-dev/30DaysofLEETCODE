//Write an algorithm to determine if a number is "happy".

A happy number is a number defined by the following process: Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers.

public:
    int dp[100000] = {0};
    bool isHappy(int num) {
        int sum = 0;
        int i = 0;
        while(i != 6)
        {  i++;
            while(num>0)
        {  int rem = num%10;
            sum += rem*rem;
            num=num/10;
        }
            num = sum;
 
       
         
                if(sum==1)
                    return true;

                    return false;
                }
                else
                {
                    dp[sum]= 1;
